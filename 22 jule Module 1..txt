Q.1 What Is Software? What Is Software Engineering?
Ans. It Is A Part Of Computer That We Cannot Toch Physically. We Can Just See The Software.
Software Engineering Is The Branch Of Computer Science That Deals With The Desing,Development,Testing,And MAintenance Of Software
Applications. Software Engineer Apply Engineering Principles And Knowledge Of Programming Lannguages To Build Software Solutions For End Users.


Q.2 Explain Types Of Software ?
Ans. 5 Types Of Software 

*  Application Software
*  System Software
*  Driver Software
*  Middleware
*  Programming Software. 

* Application Software :-

-> The most common type of software,application software is a computer software package that performs a specific function
     for a user, or in some cases, for another application.

-> An application can be self-contained, or it can be a group of programs that run the application for the user.

-> Examples Of Modern Applications include office suites, graphics software,databases and database management programs, Web browsers,
     Word procesors, software development tools, image editors and communication platforms.

Ex. Microsoft Office,Paint,Powerpoint etc.

* System Software:-

->These Software Programs are designed to run a computer's application programs and hardware.

->System Software coordinate theactivities and function of the hardware and softwere.

->It controls the operations of the computer hardware and provides an environment or platform for all the other types of software to
   work in.
->The OS is the best example of system software;it manages all the other computer programs.

->Other examples of system software include the firmare,computer languge translators and system utilities..

Ex. Notepad, Calculator etc..

* Driver Software
->Also known as device drivers, this software is often considered a typs of  system software.

->Device drivers control the devices and peripherals conncected to a computer, enabling them to perform their specific tasks.

->Every devices that is connected to a computer needs at least one device driver to function.

->Examples include software that comes with any nonstandard hardware, including special game controllers, as well as the software that 
    enables standard hardware, such as USB storage device, keyboards,headphones and printers.

Ex. AudioDriver, Video Driver etc...

* Middleware 
->The tern middleware describes software that mediates between application and system or between two different kind of application 
    software . For Example, middleware enables Microsoft Windowa to talk To Excel and Word.

->It is also used to send a remote work request from an application in a computer that has one kind of OS, to an application in a computer
   With a different OS. It also enables newer applications to work with legacy ones.

Ex.database middleware, application server middleware.

*Programming Software
->Computer Programmers use programming software to write code. Programming software and programming tools enable developres
    to develop, write,test anddebugother software programs.
->Examples of programming software include assemblers, compilers, debuggers and interpreters.

Ex.Turbo c, Eclipse, Sublime etc...

Q.3 What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC
Ans. SDLC :- Software Development Life Cycle refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality
       software.

-> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software.
    in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software delvopment :

1.Requirment Gathering.
2.Analysis.
3.Designing
4.Implementation.
5.Testing.
6.Maintenance.

Q.4 What is DFD?Create a DFD diagram on Flipkart?
Ans. DFD is the abbreviation for Data Flow Diagram. The flow of data of a system or a process is represented by DFD.
         It also gives insight into the inputs and output of eachentity and the pocess itself. DFD dose not have control flow 
         and no loops or decision rules are present. Specific operations depending on the type of data can be explained by 
         a flowchar.
